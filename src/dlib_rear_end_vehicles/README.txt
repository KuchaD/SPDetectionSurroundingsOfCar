This dataset contains 2352 images, each captured from a camera mounted to a
car's dashboard.  In each image, all cars that are viewed from the rear (i.e.
you can see their rear bumper) are annotated with a bounding box.  The purpose of
the dataset was accompany dlib's MMOD+CNN examples and illustrate how to train
an object detector with these tools.  For an introduction to these tools, see:

The images in this dataset were collected from parts of the TME Motorway
dataset as well as a few different youtube videos.  Their URLs are as follows:
